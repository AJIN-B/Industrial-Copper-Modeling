# Industrial Copper Modeling

## Overview

This project aims to develop two machine learning models for the copper industry to 
address the challenges of predicting selling price and lead classification.
**ML Regression model** which predicts continuous variable of **Selling_Price**.
**ML Classification model** which predicts **Status: WON or LOST**.
Created a **streamlit page** where you can insert each column value and you will get 
the predicted value of **Selling_Price  or Status(Won/Lost)**.


## Dataset Overview

The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing.
However, this data may suffer from issues such as **skewness** and noisy data, 
which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges 
manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. 
By utilizing advanced techniques such as **data normalization, feature scaling, outlier detection** and 
leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.

### Approach 

- **Data Understanding:** Identify the types of variables (continuous, categorical) and their distributions. 
- **Data Preprocessing:** 
    - Handle missing values with mean/median/mode.
    - Treat Outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest from sklearn library.
    - Identify Skewness in the dataset and treat skewness with appropriate data transformations,
    - Encode categorical variables  as one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding, based on their nature and relationship with the target variable.

- **EDA:** visualizing outliers and skewness(before and after treating skewness) using Seabornâ€™s boxplot, distplot, violinplot.
- **Feature Engineering:** Engineer new features if applicable, such as aggregating or transforming existing features to create more informative representations of the data. 

### Model Building and Evaluation:
- Split the dataset into training and testing/validation sets. 
- Train and evaluate different classification models, such as ExtraTreesClassifier, XGBClassifier, or Logistic Regression, using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC curve. 
- Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to find the best-performing model.
- Interpret the model results and assess its performance based on the defined problem statement.
